## The Game
Blackjack is a popular casino card game pitting players against the dealer. The gameplay revolves around both sides attempting to have cards sum up as close to 21 as possible without going over. Currently, the web app allows the user to play three hands at once. You will be prompted to select the amount of money to bet for each hand.

Once all bets have been placed, the game starts with each player as well as the dealer each dealt two cards. One of the dealer's card if face down. Then in a clock-wise rotation, player's are able to choose from a range of commands. HIT deals one more card while STAND ends the player's turn with their current total.

Once each player has finished their turn, the dealer flips their face down card and then must keep 'hitting' until either their hand is at least 17. After that, each player either wins or loses their bets accordingly and a new round can begin.

## Inspiration
Back in high school, my friends and I used to play card games all the time during lunch time. Games such as Big Two and Crazy Eights gave me fond memories but Blackjack in particular was unforgettable.
We used rocks and erases as our money and just had a blast pretending we were winning big money. As such, this project pays a bit of homage to my high school days as well as letting me develop my Python and general programming skills.

## The Process
The entire project is written in Python with the Pygame library used for the GUI and then converted into WebAssembly using Pygbag for deploying. Project can be expanded to
include other card games as it is comprised of a Module containing a Card and Deck class with methods for shuffling, inserting and drawing cards.

An especially challenging part was keeping track of the various components of the GUI as I had coded it entirely in one single module. As such, for both future projects and future updates to this project, I would definitely divide the GUI into different modules in order to increase readability and reduce coupling. Another big issue was the web game often lagged as card images were constantly being fetched. To resolve this, I used a dict to cache all the images needed at startup.

## Known Bugs
* Deck has the same shuffle between sessions. (i.e. player 1 will always be dealt a 3 and 2 in the first round) likely an
  stemming from compiltion into WASM
* SPLIT Button not yet implemented properly
