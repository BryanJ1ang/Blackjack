Please visit <https://bryanjiang.itch.io/blackjack> to try the game

## Inspiration
Back in high school, my friends and I used to play card games all the time during lunch time. Games such as Big Two and Crazy Eights have given me fond memories but Blackjack especially was unforgettable. 
We used rocks and erases as our money and just had a blast pretending we were winning big money. As such, this project pays a bit of homage to my high school days as well as letting me refine my Python skills.

## The Process
The entire project is written in Pythonn with Pygame used for the GUI and then converted int WebAssembly using Pygbag in order to be hosted on <[itch.io](https://itch.io/)>. Project can be expanded to 
include other card games as it is comprised of a Module containing a Card and Deck class with methods for shuffling, inserting and drawing cards.
